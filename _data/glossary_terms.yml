- term: nested let expression
  definition: A let expression within another let expression.

- term: let expression
  definition: An expression that defines a value that will be used in a specific expression.

- term: parameter

- term: tuple
  definition: A data type that consists of a pair (or trio, tetrad, pentad, etc...) of types.

- term: board
